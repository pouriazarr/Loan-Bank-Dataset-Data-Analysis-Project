# Loan Bank Dataset Data Analysis Project

A bank seeks to make smarter, safer lending decisions by analyzing customer data. This dataset offers valuable insights into customer characteristics and their loan repayment history. Identifying the traits that set apart a “good” customer from a “risky” one is crucial—not only to minimize losses but also to maximize the bank’s success and foster responsible borrowing. Unlocking these patterns empowers the bank to build stronger customer relationships and drive sustainable growth.
